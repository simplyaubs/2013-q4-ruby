Some project ideas:

#Obviously, I have put the most effort into the TutorTrade option and that is what I'd like to do. I did list two additional ideas just in case.

TutorTrade

"A web-based exchange that helps students coordinate both giving and receiving tutoring time."

	-bank hours = give 1 hour, get 1 hour
	-tutor in a subject of your choice
	-rate quality of tutors

		>eventually, I'd like to open it up to all people...not just students and universities (trade 1 hour Ruby tutoring for 1 hour Guitar Lesson)
